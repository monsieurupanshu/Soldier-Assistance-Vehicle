# Overview
The RAKSHAK project is a design and research initiative focused on developing an unmanned Soldier Assistance Vehicle (SAV). This innovative vehicle is designed to autonomously support military personnel by carrying essential supplies and ammunition, with a carrying capacity of up to 200 kg. It is engineered to autonomously follow a battalion, and it also offers the option of remote control for manual manipulation. The project is currently in the design and research phase and has not yet been implemented.

# Features
- Autonomous Navigation: This technology utilizes proprioceptive sensors (Wheel Encoders, IMUs, GPS) and exteroceptive sensors (LiDAR, Stereo Vision, Ultrasonic Range Sensors) for accurate positioning and environmental mapping.
- Obstacle Avoidance: Employs advanced sensing technologies for detecting and avoiding obstacles
- Local Mapping: Capable of generating local maps from sensor data to navigate safely.
- Motion Control: Manages path trajectory and speed effectively.

# Technology Stack
- Proprioceptive Sensors: Wheel Encoders, IMUs, GPS
- Exteroceptive Sensors: LiDAR, Stereo Vision, Ultrasonic Range Sensors
- Software: Autonomous navigation and mapping algorithms
